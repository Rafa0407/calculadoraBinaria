This is my first contribution on github, with this starter project you can do a single app using Angular js, Angular Material as a UI Component framework, ui-router -> https://scotch.io/tutorials/angular-routing-using-ui-router. 
I implement Gulp for task manager. 

You must have 
- Node.js -> https://nodejs.org/es/download/  and 
- Bower -> https://bower.io/ installed

After install everything, just type: 
- npm install 
- and then, change your path to app/ and type bower install
- return to the principal path of the project and type gulp

With the gulp task, the browser will reload automatically  if one file (.css .js .scss) have a change

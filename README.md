This is my first contribution on github, with this starter project you can do a single app using Angular Material as a UI Component framework and Angular.js, 
I implement Gulp for task manager. 

You must have 
- Node.js -> https://nodejs.org/es/download/  and 
- Bower -> https://bower.io/ installed

After install everything, just type: 
npm install 
and then, change your path to app/ and type bower install
